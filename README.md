    python multiplication_algorithms.py
```


## Scripts

1. **multiplication_algorithms.py**: Implements various multiplication algorithms, including naive, Python's built-in, and Karatsuba multiplication.

2. **bfs.py**: Demonstrates Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm implementation on a graph.

3. **dynamic_programming_memoization.py**: Solves the "Unique Paths" problem using dynamic programming with memoization.

4. **chat_room.py**: Simulates a real-time chat room with concurrent user interactions.

5. **collections_itertools.py**: Demonstrates the usage of Python's collections and itertools modules for efficient data manipulation.

6. **min_max-heap.py**: Implements min-heap and max-heap data structures and their operations.

7. **travelling_salesman.py**: Solves the Travelling Salesman Problem using dynamic programming.

8. **dfs.py**: Implements the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for graph traversal.

9. **graph_traversal.py**: Finds all possible paths between two nodes in a graph.

10. **longest_palidromic_string.py**: Finds the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

11. **circular_linked_lists.py**: Implements and traverses a circular linked list.
