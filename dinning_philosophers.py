    Problem Type: Synchronization, Dining Philosophers Problem
    
    Problem Statement:
    The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem. It involves a certain number of philosophers sitting at a table, each with a plate of food and a fork on either side. A philosopher needs both forks to eat, but can only pick up one fork at a time. The problem is to design a protocol that the philosophers can use to avoid deadlock and starvation.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of philosophers.
    
    Methods:
    wants_to_eat(philosopher, pick_left_fork, pick_right_fork, eat, put_left_fork, put_right_fork): The method that simulates a philosopher wanting to eat.
    
    Example:
    philosophers = DiningPhilosophers(5)
    philosophers.wants_to_eat(0, pick_left_fork, pick_right_fork, eat, put_left_fork, put_right_fork)

    Each philosopher needs both forks to eat, but can only pick up one fork at a time.
