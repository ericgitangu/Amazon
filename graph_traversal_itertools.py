    Problem Type: Graph Traversal, Path Finding
    
    Problem Statement:
    Given a graph represented as an adjacency list, a starting node, and an ending node, find all possible paths from the start node to the end node using itertools and combinations.
    
    Parameters:
    graph (Dict[Any, List[Any]]): The graph represented as an adjacency list.
    start (Any): The starting node for the path finding.
    end (Any): The ending node for the path finding.
    
    Returns:
    List[List[Any]]: A list of all possible paths from the start node to the end node.
